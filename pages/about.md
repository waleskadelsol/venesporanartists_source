## About the Venesporan Artists Project

The Venesporan Artists Project (VAP) is an experimental platform that can aid us in discovering artists of the Venezuela diaspora, or what Waleska Sol√≥rzano terms the Venespora, by engaging with digital tools and methodologies. The aim of VAP is to bring together Venezuelan artists from all backgrounds, identities, and locations in one (digital) space to delve into diasporic experiences beyond definitions, distinguish patterns, form connections, and ignite conversations across a vast space. This platform also works as an archival work in progress that chronicles contemporary art and artists of Venezuelan descent and identity dispersed across international borders. As an archival platform, VAP focuses on preserving data, such as the personal and official websites, belonging to artists in the Venespora to ensure its availability so that galleries, museums, universities, and related entities can browse and search through artistic content. VAP is open to all who are curious about artists of the Venespora, but it may be particularly useful for those researching and tracking living Venezuelan artists active from 1992 to the present.
